# Olmypic-Analysys

for my EDA, i used the athleate.csv file my analysis. The visualizations of the data that i created mostly centered aroung bar graphs, as with a large set of data, i was able to compute the information better. I used the libaries matplotlib, and pandas, along with SNS. 

The methords of data collection i used is by maluplating the exsiting datasets to get the desired resualts. 


# Olmypic-Insights:

the main findings from my research that i found is that there are not a lot of people who won a gold medal over the age of 40, this insight lead tme to belive that olympic athleates start losing their performance at the age of forty. 
it also shows the improvement of the ratio of male and female atheleats since 1940. 
#How i got the insights 
the insights were carefuly analysed from the multple EDA representations i have done. 

#Training plan

based on my data i have analyzed that more rigrius trainng programs should be put into place to athleats over the age of 30 to help them be fitter when they are 40. this would help the curve of more gold medalists. 


#Sponsorship deals

The sponsorships that should go to the olympics should target the audience of 20 to 30 year olds to have a better chance of securing payment


#Gender equality

the next steop for gender equality is to have mixed events where male and female partcpants could be there. this would increse the likelyhood of more female partcpation.
