# Olympic-Analysys

For my EDA, I used the athlete.csv file for my analysis. The visualizations of the data that I created mostly centered around bar graphs, as with a large dataset, I was able to interpret the information better. I used the libraries Matplotlib, Pandas, along with Seaborn (sns).

The methods of data collection I used involved manipulating the existing datasets to get the desired results.


# Olympic-Insights:

The main findings from my research are that there are not many people who have won a gold medal over the age of 40. This insight led me to believe that Olympic athletes start losing their performance around the age of forty.
It also shows the improvement in the ratio of male and female athletes since 1940.



# Training plan

Based on my data, I have analyzed that more rigorous training programs should be put in place for athletes over the age of 30 to help them stay fitter by the time they are 40. This could help increase the number of gold medalists in that age group.

# Sponsorship deals

Sponsorships for the Olympics should target the audience of 20- to 30-year-olds to have a better chance of securing revenue.


# Gender equality

The next step for gender equality is to have mixed events where male and female participants can compete together. This would increase the likelihood of more female participation.
