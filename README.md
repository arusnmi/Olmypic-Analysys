# Olmypic-Analysys

for my EDA, i used the athleate.csv file my analysis. The visualizations of the data that i created mostly centered aroung bar graphs, as with a large set of data, i was able to compute the information better.

The methords of data collection i used is by maluplating the exsiting datasets to get the desired resualts.
